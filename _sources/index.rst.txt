UWS API Server Documentation
============================================

This repo implements a Universal Worker Service (UWS) API server for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to provide an asynchronous job management system that follows the `Universal Worker Service Pattern defined by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance <https://www.ivoa.net/documents/UWS/>`_.

    The Universal Worker Service (UWS) pattern defines how to manage asynchronous execution of jobs on a service. Any application of the pattern defines a family of related services with a common service contract. Possible uses of the pattern are also described.
